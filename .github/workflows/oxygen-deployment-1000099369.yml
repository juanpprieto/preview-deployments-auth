# =============================================================================
# Hydrogen → Oxygen Deployment (Storefront 1000099369)
# =============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Builds and deploys the Hydrogen storefront to Shopify Oxygen on every push.
#   Generates an auth bypass token so private environments (staging, dev) can be
#   accessed via URL parameter (?_auth=TOKEN) or HTTP header.
#
# MULTI-ENVIRONMENT STRATEGY:
#   Branch  →  Oxygen Environment  →  Sanity Dataset  →  Visibility
#   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   main     →  Production           →  production       →  Public (no auth needed)
#   staging  →  Staging              →  staging          →  Private (auth required)
#   dev      →  Dev                  →  dev              →  Private (auth required)
#   *        →  Preview              →  staging          →  Private (auth required)
#
# DATASET INJECTION (BUILD-TIME):
#   Shopify Oxygen does NOT support per-environment runtime env vars with the
#   same name. Instead, we inject the dataset at BUILD TIME via the VITE_SANITY_DATASET
#   env var. Vite bakes `import.meta.env.VITE_SANITY_DATASET` into the bundle.
#   This means the dataset is frozen at deploy time — which is correct behavior
#   since each Oxygen environment maps to exactly one Sanity dataset.
#
# AUTH BYPASS TOKENS (two types):
#   - TESTING_AUTOMATION (--auth-bypass-token): Has `exp`, max 12h. Written to
#     h2_deploy_log.json. Used for CI smoke tests only — NOT synced to Sanity.
#   - USER_SHARED (shopify[bot] PR comment): No `exp`, no time-based expiry.
#     Deployment-scoped only. THIS is what the sync workflow syncs to Sanity.
#     Validated at 56h+ still returning HTTP 200.
#   Both work as ?_auth= URL param or oxygen-auth-bypass-token header.
#   See: decisions/sanity-presentation-oxygen-auth.md → "USER_SHARED Token Longevity"
#
# COMPANION WORKFLOWS:
#   - sanity-oxygen-bypass-sync.yml: Reads shopify[bot] PR comment → writes
#     token to Sanity so Studio Presentation tool can load the preview iframe

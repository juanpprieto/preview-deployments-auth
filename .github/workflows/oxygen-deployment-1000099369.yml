# =============================================================================
# Hydrogen → Oxygen Deployment (Storefront 1000099369)
# =============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Builds and deploys the Hydrogen storefront to Shopify Oxygen on every push.
#   Generates an auth bypass token so private environments (staging, dev) can be
#   accessed via URL parameter (?_auth=TOKEN) or HTTP header.
#
# MULTI-ENVIRONMENT STRATEGY:
#   Branch  →  Oxygen Environment  →  Sanity Dataset  →  Visibility
#   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   main     →  Production           →  production       →  Public (no auth needed)
#   staging  →  Staging              →  staging          →  Private (auth required)
#   dev      →  Dev                  →  dev              →  Private (auth required)
#   *        →  Preview              →  staging          →  Private (auth required)
#
# DATASET SELECTION (RUNTIME):
#   Each Oxygen environment has SANITY_DATASET set as a runtime env var
#   in Shopify admin (Settings → Environments → Environment Variables).
#   The Hydrogen app reads `env.SANITY_DATASET` at runtime to select
#   the correct Sanity dataset. No build-time injection needed.
#
# AUTH BYPASS TOKENS (two types):
#   - TESTING_AUTOMATION (--auth-bypass-token): Has `exp`, max 12h. Written to
#     h2_deploy_log.json. Used for CI smoke tests only — NOT synced to Sanity.
#   - USER_SHARED (shopify[bot] PR comment): No `exp`, no time-based expiry.
#     Deployment-scoped only. THIS is what the sync workflow syncs to Sanity.
#     Validated at 56h+ still returning HTTP 200.
#   Both work as ?_auth= URL param or oxygen-auth-bypass-token header.
#   See: decisions/sanity-presentation-oxygen-auth.md → "USER_SHARED Token Longevity"
#
# COMPANION WORKFLOWS:
#   - sanity-oxygen-bypass-sync.yml: Reads shopify[bot] PR comment → writes
#     token to Sanity so Studio Presentation tool can load the preview iframe
